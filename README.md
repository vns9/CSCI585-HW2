- Bonus(1(+1) point(s)). For Q2, you will get 1 extra point if you can reformulate the query in a very different way! If you do this, submit a separate text file with the code, eg. Q2_v2.sql. If you come up with YET ANOTHER very different way, you can get 1 more bonus point (submit yet another file, eg. Q2_v3.sql). 'Very different' means just that - the approaches do have to be totally distinct, eg. you can't use NOT to invert an existing solution, or use IN() instead of OR, etc.
